title: 6. Creating the Interface file for JWT

In the root of the project, create a file called `next-auth.d.ts` and include the following code:

- `next-auth.d.ts`

<details><summary><b>pages/reminder.tsx</b></summary>
<br/>

```tsx
import "next-auth/jwt"

// Read more at: https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/typescript#module-augmentation

declare module "next-auth/jwt" {
  interface JWT {
    userRole?: "admin",
    accessToken?: string,
    refreshToken?: string,
  }
}
```

</details>
<br />

Nothing very complicated here. But it is important that you understand what is happening here. The `next-auth/jwt` is a module that exports an interface called `JWT`. We are telling TypeScript that we want to extend this interface with the properties `userRole`, `accessToken` and `refreshToken`. This allows us to access these properties anywhere in our code. For example, if you try to access `session.userRole` somewhere in your code, TypeScript won't complain. This is very useful because you don't need to import the `session` everywhere. You can simply access the properties you need.

This means TypeScript Augmentation. **[You can read more about it](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/typescript#module-augmentation)**.

Finally we can test our application. Run the command `npm run dev` and access the application at `http://localhost:3000/reminder`. 

Make the login using the credentials you created in the previous step. If everything is ok, your name will be displayed on the screen.

Before to click in the `Start Timer` button, you will need to connect on Microsoft Teams. Remember that you will need to use the email that you created before in the M365 Developer Program.

Let your status as `Available`.

Return to the application and click in the `Start Timer` button. Wait for 2 minutes. After that, an alert message will pop up in your screen saying: `Take a break!`.

But if the user has a status differente from `Available`? What will happen? If you try to click in the `Start Timer`, it will inform you that you're `Offline` or `Busy` or any other status different from `Available`.

And, congratulations! You have created a simple application that uses the Microsoft Graph API to get the user status and the NextAuth to authenticate the user.
