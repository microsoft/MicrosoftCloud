# Tutorial: ACS Video to Teams Meeting Lab 

In this tutorial you'll learn how Azure Communication Services can be used in a custom React app to allow a user to call into a Microsoft Teams meeting. 

### Pre-requisites:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Azure Functions Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/search)
- [Microsoft 365 developer tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program)

### Technologies used in this tutorial include:
- React
- Azure Communication Services
- Azure Functions
- Microsoft Graph
- Microsoft Teams

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Communication Services Resource using the Azure Portal

In this exercise you'll create an Azure Communication Services (ACS) resource in the Azure Portal.

1. Visit https://portal.azure.com in your browser and login.

1. Type `communication services` in the top search bar and select `Communication Services` from the options that appear.


    ![ACS in the Azure Portal](./images/acs-to-teams-meeting/search-acs-portal.png "Azure Communication Services")

1. Select `Create` in the toolbar.

1. Perform the following tasks:
    - Select your subscription.
    - Select the resource group to use (create a new one if needed).
    - Enter an ACS resource name. It must be a unique value.
    - Select a data location.

1. Select `Review + Create` followed by `Create`.

1. Once your ACS resource is created, navigate to it and select `Settings --> Identities & User Access Tokens`.

1. Select the `Voice and video calling (VOIP)` checkbox.

1. Select `Generate`.

1. Copy the `Identity` and `User Access token` values to a local file. You'll need those values later in this exercise.

    ![User identity and token](./images/acs-to-teams-meeting/user-identity-token.png "User identity and token")

1. Select `Settings --> Keys` and copy the `Primary key` connection string value to the same location as the user identity and token values.

1. To run the application you'll need a Teams meeting link. Go to https://teams.microsoft.com, login with your Microsoft 365 developer tenant, and select the `Calendar` option on the left. 

    > NOTE: If you don't currently have a Microsoft 365 account, you can sign up for the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://cda.ms/1Jp) subscription. It's *free* for 90 days and will continually renew as long as you're using it for development activity. If you have a Visual Studio *Enterprise* or *Professional* subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 [developer subscription](https://aka.ms/MyVisualStudioBenefits), active for the life of your Visual Studio subscription. *See* [Set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription](https://cda.ms/1Jq).

1. Select a date/time on the calendar, add a title for the meeting, and select `Save`.

1. Select the new meeting you added in the calendar and copy the Teams meeting link that is displayed into the same file where you stored the ACS user identity, token, and connection string.

    ![Teams Meeting Join Link](./images/acs-to-teams-meeting/teams-meeting-link.png "Teams Meeting Join Link")

1. Now that your ACS resource is setup and you have a Teams meeting join link, let's get the React application up and running.

## Exercise 2: Integrate Azure Communication Services Calling into a React App

In this exercise you'll add the [ACS UI calling composite](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/composites-call-joinexistingcall--join-existing-call) into a React app to enable making audio/video calls from a custom app into a Microsoft Teams meeting.

1. Run the following command to clone this repository to your machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftCloud
    ```

1. Open the `samples/acs-video-to-teams-meeting/client/react` project folder in Visual Studio Code. 

1. Open the `package.json` file in VS Code and note the following ACS packages are included:

    ```bash
    @azure/communication-common 
    @azure/communication-react
    ``` 

1. Run `npm install` in the `react` folder to install the application dependencies.

1. Open `App.tsx` and take a moment to expore the imports at the top of the file. These handle importing ACS security and calling symbols that will be used in the app.

    ```typescript
    import { 
        AzureCommunicationTokenCredential,
        CommunicationUserIdentifier 
    } from '@azure/communication-common';
    import {  
      CallComposite, 
      fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier, 
      useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter 
    } from '@azure/communication-react';
    import React, { useState, useMemo, useEffect } from 'react';
    import './App.css';
    ```

    > NOTE: You'll see how the `CallComposite` component is used later in this exercise. It provides the core UI functionality for Azure Communication Services to enable making a call from the app into a Microsoft Teams meeting.

1. Locate the `App` component and perform the following tasks:
    - Take a moment to examine the `useState` definitions in the component.
    - Replace the `userId` `useState` function's empty quotes with the ACS user identity value you copied in the previous exercise.
    - Replace the `token` `useState` function's empty quotes with the ACS token value you copied in the previous exercise.
    - Replace the `teamsMeetingLink` `useState` function's empty quotes with the Teams meeting link value you copied in the previous exercise.

    ```typescript
    // Replace '' with the ACS user identity value
    const [userId, setUserId] = useState<string>('');

    // Replace '' with the ACS token value
    const [token, setToken] = useState<string>('');

    // Replace '' with the Teams meeting link value
    const [teamsMeetingLink, setTeamsMeetingLink] = useState<string>('');
    ```

    > NOTE: Later in this tutorial you'll see how to retrieve the `userId` and `token` values dynamically from Azure Communication Services.

1. Take a moment to explore the `useMemo` functions in the `App` component.
    - The `credential` `useMemo` function creates a new `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` instance once the token has a value.
    - The `callAdapterArgs` `useMemo` function returns an object that has the arguments that are used to make an audio/video call.

    ```typescript
    const credential = useMemo(() => {
        if (token) {
            return new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(token)
        }
        return;
    }, [token]);

    const callAdapterArgs = useMemo(() => {
        if (userId && credential && displayName && teamsMeetingLink) {
            return {
                userId: fromFlatCommunicationIdentifier(userId) as CommunicationUserIdentifier,
                displayName,
                credential,
                locator: { meetingLink: teamsMeetingLink },
            }
        }
        return {};
    }, [userId, credential, displayName, teamsMeetingLink]);
    ```

    > NOTE: `useMemo` is used in this scenario because we only want the `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` object and the call adapter args to be created once as the necessary parameters are passed in. View additional details about [useMemo](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo).

1. Once the `credentials` and `callAdapterArgs` are ready, the following line handles creating an ACS call adapter using the `useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter` hook provided by ACS. The `callAdapter` object will be used later in the UI calling composite component.

    ```typescript
    const callAdapter = useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter(callAdapterArgs);
    ```

    > NOTE: Because `useAzureCommunicationCallAdapter` is a React hook, it won't assign a value to `callAdapter` until the `callAdapterArgs` value is valid.

1. Earlier you assigned the user identity, token, and Teams meeting link to state values in the `App` component. That works fine for now. In a later exercise you'll see how to dynamically retrieve those values. Since you set the values earlier, comment out the code in the `useEffect` function (the `init()` function and the call to it). Once you get the Azure Functions running in the next exercises you'll revisit this code.

    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
        /* Commenting out for now
        const init = async () => {
            setMessage('Getting ACS user');
            //Call Azure Function to get the ACS user identity and token
            let res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_ACS_USER_FUNCTION as string);
            let user = await res.json();
            setUserId(user.userId);
            setToken(user.token);

            setMessage('Getting Teams meeting link...');
            //Call Azure Function to get the meeting link
            res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMS_MEETING_FUNCTION as string);
            let link = await res.text();
            setTeamsMeetingLink(link);
            setMessage('');
            console.log('Teams meeting link', link);
        }
        init();
        */
    }, []);
    ```

1. Locate the following JSX code. It uses the `CallComposite` symbol you saw imported to render the user interface used to make an audio/video call from the React app into a Teams meeting. The `callAdapter` you explored earlier is passed to its `adapter` property.

    ```jsx
    if (callAdapter) {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Contact Customer Service</h1>
                <div className="wrapper">
                    <CallComposite
                        adapter={callAdapter} 
                    />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

1. Save the file before continuing.

1. Run `npm start` to run the application. After it builds you should see a calling UI displayed. Enable selecting your microphone and camera and initiate the call. You should see that you're placed in a waiting room. If you join the meeting you setup earlier in Microsoft Teams, you can allow the guest to enter the meeting.

1. Press `ctrl+c` to stop the application. Now that you've successfully run it, let's explore how you can dynamically get the ACS user identity and token and automatically create a Microsoft Teams meeting and return the join URL using Microsoft Graph.

## Exercise 3: Dynamically Create a Microsoft Teams Meeting Link
In this exercise, you'll automate the process of creating a Microsoft Teams meeting link and passing to the ACS by using Azure Functions and Microsoft Graph.

1. Create Azure Active Directory (AAD) app for Deamon app authentication. In this step, authentication will be handled in the backgroud with app credentials, and AAD app will use Application Permissions to make Microsoft Graph API calls:
    1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select `Azure Active Directory`.
    1. Select `App registration` tab and then `+ New registration`.
    1. Fill the new app registration form details as below and select `Register`:
        - Name: *ACS Teams Interop App*
        - Supported account types: *Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)*
        - Redirect URI: leave this area blank
    1. After the app is registered successfully, go to `API permissions` and select `+ Add a permission`.
    1. Select `Microsoft Graph`, then `Application permissions`, select **Calendars.ReadWrite** permission and `Add`.
    1. After adding the permissions, select `Grant admin consent for <your organization name>`.
    1. Go to `Certificates & secrets` tab and select `+ New client secret`, select `Add`. Copy the value of the secret, you'll use it in the next steps of the exercise.
    1. Go to `Overview` tab and copy `Application (client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID`, you'll use it in the next steps of the exercise.

1. Open `samples/acs-video-to-teams-meeting/server/typescript` project folder in Visual Studio Code.

1. Go to `TeamsMeetingFunction` folder and create a `local.settings.json` file with the following values:
    - Define `TENANT_ID`, `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with the copied details from the Azure Active Directory app.
    - Define `USER_ID` with the user id that you'd like to create a Microsoft Teams Meeting. 
    ```json
    {
        "IsEncrypted": false,
        "Values": {
            "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
            "TENANT_ID": "",
            "CLIENT_ID": "",
            "CLIENT_SECRET": "",
            "USER_ID": "",
            "ACS_CONNECTION_STRING": ""
        },
        "Host": {
            "LocalHttpPort": 7071,
            "CORS": "*",
            "CORSCredentials": false
        },
        "watchDirectories": [
            "Shared"
        ]
    }
    ```
    >NOTE: `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING` will be used in the next exercise.

1. Open the `package.json` file in VS Code and note that the following Microsoft Graph and Identity packages are included:

    ```bash
    @azure/communication-identity
    @azure/identity
    @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client
    ```
1. Run npm install in the `typesript` folder to install the application dependencies.

1. Open `Shared/graph.ts` and take a moment to expore the imports at the top of the file. These handle importing authentication and client symbols that will be used in the function to call Microsoft Graph.

    ```typescipt
    import {startDateTimeAsync, endDateTimeAsync} from './dateTimeFormat';
    import {ClientSecretCredential} from '@azure/identity';
    import {Client} from '@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client';
    import {TokenCredentialAuthenticationProvider} from '@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client/authProviders/azureTokenCredentials';
    import 'isomorphic-fetch';
    ```
    >NOTE: You'll also see imports from `dateTimeFormat.ts` which will be used later in this exercise. `startDateTimeAsync` and `endDateTimeAsync` will be used while creating a Microsoft Teams meeting link to define start date and end date for the meeting. 

1. Take a moment to examine `clientSecretCredential` and `appGraphClient`, they will be used later in the authentication process and calling the Microsoft Graph API:
    ```typescript
    let clientSecretCredential;
    let appGraphClient;
    ```

1. Locate `ensureGraphForAppOnlyAuth` function:
    - `ClientSecretCredential` consumes `Tenant Id`, `Client Id` and `Client Secret` of the Azure Active Directory app.
    - Authentication is built for a Deamon App. `authProvider` is defined as Azure Active Directory app will authenticate in the background and consume app-only permissions to make Microsoft Graph API calls.  

    ```typescript
    function ensureGraphForAppOnlyAuth() {
        if (!clientSecretCredential) {
            clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
            process.env.TENANT_ID,
            process.env.CLIENT_ID,
            process.env.CLIENT_SECRET
            );
        }

        if (!appGraphClient) {
            const authProvider = new TokenCredentialAuthenticationProvider(
            clientSecretCredential, {
                scopes: [ 'https://graph.microsoft.com/.default' ]
            });

            appGraphClient = Client.initWithMiddleware({
            authProvider: authProvider
            });
        }
        }
    ``` 

1. Take a moment to explore `createNewMeetingAsync` that calls [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/calendar-post-events?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) for creating an event in user's calendar and returns the new event details:  

    ```typescript
    async function createNewMeetingAsync(userId) {
        ensureGraphForAppOnlyAuth();
        let startTime = await startDateTimeAsync();
        let endTime = await endDateTimeAsync();
        const newMeeting = `/users/${userId}/calendar/events`;
        
        const event = {
        subject: 'Customer Service Meeting',
        start: {
            dateTime: startTime,
            timeZone: 'UTC'
        },
        end: {
            dateTime: endTime,
            timeZone: 'UTC'
        },
        isOnlineMeeting: true
        };
        
        const newEvent = await appGraphClient.api(newMeeting).post(event);    
        return newEvent;     
    }

    export default createNewMeetingAsync;
    ```

1. Go to `TeamsMeetingFunction/index.ts` and explore Http Trigger function:
    - `createNewMeetingAsync` is imported from `graph.ts`, it will be used to retrieve new event details.
    - `userId` is retrieved from `local.settings.json` inside the Http Trigger function.
    - When function is triggered, it calls `createNewMeetingAsync` with the defined user id and returns the new event details in `teamMeetingLink` parameter.
    - Function response `res` is defined as `meeting.onlineMeeting.joinUrl` that returns Microsoft Teams meeting link of the new event created in the previous step.

    ```typescript
    import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from "@azure/functions";
    import createNewMeetingAsync from '../Shared/graph';

    let teamsMeetingLink;

    const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest){
        context.log("Request received");
        const userId = process.env.USER_ID;
        context.log('UserId', userId);
        
        teamsMeetingLink = await createNewMeetingAsync(userId);
        const body = JSON.stringify(teamsMeetingLink);
        const meeting = JSON.parse(body);
        context.log("meeting:", meeting);
        
        context.res = {
            // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
            body: meeting.onlineMeeting.joinUrl
        }    
    };

    export default httpTrigger;
    ```
1. Use a terminal window to run `func host start` in the `samples/acs-video-to-teams-meeting/server/typescript` folder to run the funcgtion. Now that the `TeamsMeetingFunction` is ready to use, we can go ahead and call the function from the React app.

1. Open `samples/acs-to-teams-meeting/client/react/App.tsx` file in VS Code.

1. Locate the `teamsMeetingLink` state variable in the component. Remove the hardcoded teams link and replace it with empty quotes:

    ```typescript
    const [teamsMeetingLink, setTeamsMeetingLink] = useState<string>('');
    ```

1. Locate the `useEffect` function and change it to look like the following to enable calling the Azure Function to create a Teams meeting and retrieve the join link: 

    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
        const init = async () => {
            /* Commenting out for now
            setMessage('Getting ACS user');
            //Call Azure Function to get the ACS user identity and token
            let res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_ACS_USER_FUNCTION as string);
            let user = await res.json();
            setUserId(user.userId);
            setToken(user.token);
            */
            
            setMessage('Getting Teams meeting link...');
            //Call Azure Function to get the meeting link
            res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMS_MEETING_FUNCTION as string);
            let link = await res.text();
            setTeamsMeetingLink(link);
            setMessage('');
            console.log('Teams meeting link', link);

        }
        init();

    }, []);
    ```

1. Save the file before continuing.

1. Use a terminal window to run `npm start` in the `react` folder to run the application. After it builds you should see the calling UI displayed and you can call into the Teams meeting that was dynamically created by Microsoft Graph.

1. Stop both of the terminal processes (React and Azure Functions) by selecting `ctrl + c`.

## Exercise 4: Dynamically Create an Azure Communication Services Identity and Token

In this exercise you'll learn how to dynamically retrieve  user identity and token values from Azure Communication Services using Azure Functions.

1. Open `local.settings.json` and update the `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING` value with the ACS connection string you saved in an earlier exercise.

1. Open `samples/acs-to-teams-meeting/server/typescript/ACSTokenFunction/index.ts` in VS Code. 

1. Notice that it has the following import at the top of the file:

    ```typescript
    import { CommunicationIdentityClient } from '@azure/communication-identity';

    ```

1. The function performs the following tasks:
    - Gets the ACS connection string from an environment variable named `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING`.

        ```typescript
        const connectionString = process.env.ACS_CONNECTION_STRING;
        ```

        > NOTE: This is the connection string value you added into the `local.settings.json` file earlier.
    
    - Creates a new `CommunicationIdentityClient` instance and passes the ACS connection string to it.

        ```typescript
        let tokenClient = new CommunicationIdentityClient(connectionString);
        ```

    - Creates an ACS user and gets a Voice Over IP token.

        ```typescript
        const user = await tokenClient.createUser();
        const userToken = await tokenClient.getToken(user, ["voip"]);
        ```

    - Sends the userId and token values back to the caller.

        ```typescript
        context.res = {
            body: { userId: user.communicationUserId, ...userToken }
        };
        ```

1. Go to the `samples/acs-to-teams-meeting/server/typescript` folder in a terminal window and run `npm start`.

1. Now that the Azure Functions are running locally, the client needs to be able to call into them to get the ACS user identity and token values.

1. Open `samples/acs-to-teams-meeting/client/react/App.tsx` file in your editor.

1. Locate the `userId` and `token` state variables in the component. Remove the hardcoded values and replace them with empty quotes:

    ```typescript
    const [userId, setUserId] = useState<string>('');
    const [token, setToken] = useState<string>('');
    ```

1.  Locate the `useEffect` function and change it to look like the following to enable calling the Azure Function to retrieve an ACS user identity and token: 

    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
        const init = async () => {
            setMessage('Getting ACS user');
            //Call Azure Function to get the ACS user identity and token
            let res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_ACS_USER_FUNCTION as string);
            let user = await res.json();
            setUserId(user.userId);
            setToken(user.token);
            
            setMessage('Getting Teams meeting link...');
            //Call Azure Function to get the meeting link
            res = await fetch(process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMS_MEETING_FUNCTION as string);
            let link = await res.text();
            setTeamsMeetingLink(link);
            setMessage('');
            console.log('Teams meeting link', link);
        }
        init();

    }, []);
    ```

1. Save the file before continuing.

1. Run `npm start` to run the application. After it builds you should see the ACS calling UI displayed and you can call into the Teams meeting that was dynamically created by Microsoft Graph.

1. Stop both of the terminal processes (React and Azure Functions) by selecting `ctrl + c`.

1. You've successfully completed this tutorial!
